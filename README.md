# Build a Database-Driven React App

Week 7 Assignment - Build a Database Driven Full-Stack React & Express App

## Requirements
- 🎯 Create a client using React. ✅
- 🎯 Use Express to create your server, using both GET and POST endpoints. ✅
- 🎯 Build a React form for users to create posts. ✅
- 🎯 Create multiple pages using React Router. ✅
- 🎯 Design a database schema, and seed the database with some realistic data. ✅
- 🎯 Use SQL to retrieve posts from the database in your Express server. ✅
- 🎯 Display all posts using .map(). ✅
- 🎯 Use an interval and useEffect() to poll your database. ✅

## Stretch Requirements

- 🏹 Use react-router-dom to create a dedicated route for the categories
    - For example, /posts/:categoryName.
- 🏹 Allow users to delete posts.
- 🏹 Add ‘like’ functionality on posts.
- 🏹 Create additional SQL queries to show filtered posts.

## Reflection
This week, we were tasked with creating a full-stack application that can submit and retrieve data from a database using React and Express. While this is similar to the work we completed in week 4 and during the group project, the key difference for this assignment was the use of React for the front-end.

For my project, I decided to create a Hogwarts-style personality quiz, where users can discover which house they belong to based on their responses to a series of questions. For the database, I chose to store only the quiz results rather than the full form data. With this approach, I anticipated a significant amount of logic would be required to calculate and store the results accurately. This is where I encountered the main challenges of the assignment, as implementing this logic proved more complex than I initially expected.
